			<h1>Lead Frontend Engineer</h1>
		
			<p>
				I’m Bryan, a lead frontend engineer (Christian first) who cares deeply about
				building quality software, both inside and out. I think of myself as a problem solver
				who happens to write code, mostly on the frontend, and occasionally on the backend
				when it helps the team move faster.
			</p>
		
			<p>
				I’m currently at <a href="https://firstbase.com" target="_blank">Firstbase</a>, a recently acquired startup building logistical
				infrastructure for remote workers. Over the last four years I’ve been solving
				problems with React, TypeScript, and other modern web technologies.
			</p>
		
			<p>Some of the work I’ve done recently:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					Shipped revenue-driving features such as custom table views, expedited shipping
					support, and a customer-facing catalog.
				</li>
				<li>
					Paid down critical frontend tech debt by refactoring legacy code, increasing test
					coverage, and making the codebase easier and safer to change.
				</li>
				<li>
					Helped design and implement a shared design system in collaboration with our new
					parent company, improving UI consistency and developer velocity.
				</li>
			</ul>
		
			<p>
				These examples are just a small slice of what I’ve worked on. None of it happened
				in isolation. I’ve been fortunate to build alongside thoughtful engineers, designers,
				and product managers who care about doing things well.
			</p>

				If you’d like to chat about frontend architecture, performance, or how I approach
				leading teams, feel free to reach out.
