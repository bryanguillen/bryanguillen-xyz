			<h1>Lead Frontend Engineer</h1>

			<p>
				I’m Bryan Guillen — a delivery-focused lead frontend engineer with 9 years of experience building reliable,
				high-performing UIs for B2B SaaS. I ship complex React/TypeScript workflows (tables, wizards, admin tooling),
				and I care a lot about quality: testing, maintainability, and a UI that holds up at scale.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m currently at
				<a href="https://firstbase.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firstbase</a>,
				where I’ve helped scale the frontend from Series A through acquisition.
			</p>

			<p>
				If you want to see what I’ve built and how I think, head to
				<a href="/portfolio">my portfolio</a>.
